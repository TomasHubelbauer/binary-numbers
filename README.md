# Binary Numbers

[**Online demo**](https://tomashubelbauer.github.io/binary-numbers)

- Consider changing from a table to a list
- Implement a *Formula* section for each view, hex and bin, showing the conversion to dec
  - Display that with indices once and then with real values again for obviousness
- Accept hex and binary strings as input (ask about endianness or maybe show variants for all endiadnesses)
- Implement the missing 24 and 64 bit conversions by extending the `DataView` prototype
- Consider supporting mixed endian with the respective `DataView` prototype extensions
